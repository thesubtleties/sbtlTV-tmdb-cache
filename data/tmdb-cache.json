The characters, such as \"Chen Ji,\" \"Mrs. Shun,\" \"Uncle Mao,\" \"Jue Wu Yin,\" \"Miss Su,\" \"A Wei,\" and \"Ah Kang,\" mostly hail from the grassroots, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. For example, \"Mrs. Shun,\" portrayed by Lydia Shum, later became a term to describe uneducated women who follow trends blindly. \"Chen Ji,\" played by Lawrence Ng, is a stockbroker who loves to show off his wealth, and his behavior typified that of many Hong Kongers, becoming a byword for the city's nouveau riche.",

These contestants are grouped into three teams according to the theme chosen in each season. Social classes, generations, regions of the country and the degree of popularity are the elements used to give identity to these groups. Another one of the characteristics of the Challenge and which encloses the success of this format is that the conditions of life in this competition are not fair. While a group spends its day in a beach house with servants, exquisite delicacies (High Beach), the other group suffers the complete lack of accommodation and food (Low Beach). In this reality, as in real life, the teams would be able to exceed or fall on their comfort levels, depending on the performance in the territorial Challenges.",
